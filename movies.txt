# Each non-empty line should contain a direct link to a playable media file.
# Supported formats include MP4, MKV (with supported codecs), and HTTP Live
# Streaming (HLS) .m3u8 playlists.  You can create these links via
# Realâ€‘Debrid, or by copying direct links to files you host yourself.
# Lines beginning with # are ignored.  You can leave empty lines between
# entries for readability.
